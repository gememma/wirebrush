# About

I am a Rust developer interested in backend development, automating developer workflows and the
mathematics of programming.

I have experience with Rust, Haskell and Python, among other languages and frameworks. My 
dissertation was written in Rust, and explored writing an extension to an existing process calculus
to allow concurrent composition of processes.

I am also an artist and collector of many crafting hobbies from tailoring to bookbinding to
knitting. I own a total of eight gaming consoles and two sewing machines.
