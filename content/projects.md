<div> My dissertation project included writing an interpreter for a novel extension of the Functional 
Machine Calculus (FMC) to include concurrent composition, with concurrent terms running in true 
parallel. The project is in Rust and was designed to facilitate the exploration of concurrency 
through a mathematical and theoretical lens.

<div> For a 24-hour hackathon, our team of three chose to build a western-RPG called MEOWDY using Rust 
and the <a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy engine</a>. One of the judges described our project as a 
"minimum lovable product", and the project won the prize for 
"Most Entertaining".

<div class="project-icon"> <img src="static/spaceintracers.png" alt="raytracer Sprite"> </div>
<div> This application produces a raytraced image of a 3D scene with various material, object and
light types. The rendering process is parallelised over 8 threads. Other features include Fresnel
shading for dielectric material and the option to introduce depth of field to the camera. This is
the largest Rust project on this page.
