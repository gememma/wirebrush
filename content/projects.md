professional workflow with GitHub actions, a project board and feature branches in git.

<div> My dissertation project included writing an interpreter for a novel extension of the Functional 
Machine Calculus (FMC) to include concurrent composition, with concurrent terms running in true 
parallel. The project is in Rust and was designed to facilitate the exploration of concurrency 
through a mathematical and theoretical lens.

<div> For a 24-hour hackathon, our team of three chose to build a western-RPG called MEOWDY using Rust 
and the <a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy engine</a>. One of the judges described our project as a 
"minimum lovable product", and the project won the prize for 
"Most Entertaining".

<div class="project-icon"> <img src="static/spaceintracers.png" alt="Space Intracers Sprite"> </div>
<div> This project is based on the <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>
series, but written in Rust instead of the original C++. This was one of the first pieces of Rust
code I wrote.

## Plantpedia

<div class="flex-container">
<div class="project-icon"> <img src="static/plantpedia.png" alt="Plantpedia Sprite"> </div>
<div> Plantpedia is a pet project written in Python that was created after I couldn't find exactly 
what I was looking for to help take care of my plants. I was also fairly new to using CLI tools, 
so exploring text-based menus was a bonus.
