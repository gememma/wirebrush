# About

Hi! I am a **Rust developer** interested in backend development, automating developer workflows 
and the mathematics of programming.

My favourite languages are Rust, Haskell and Python, and I have experience with other languages
including C, Java, JavaScript, and Bash. My dissertation was written in Rust, and explored
writing an extension to an existing process calculus to allow concurrent composition of processes.

You can see some of my past projects on the [projects page](/projects) and my 
public code repos on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gememma/).

I am also an artist and collector of many crafting hobbies from tailoring to bookbinding to
knitting. I own a total of eight gaming consoles and two sewing machines.
