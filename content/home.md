# About

Hi there! My name is Gemma and I'm a **Rust engineer** currently working at
[metalbear.co](https://metalbear.co/), writing open source Rust for [mirrord](https://mirrord.dev/).
I'm into backend development, developer tooling and low-level programming.

My favourite language is Rust and I have experience with other languages including TypeScript,
Python, C, Java, JavaScript, and Bash. My dissertation was written in Rust, and explored writing
an extension to an existing process calculus to allow concurrent composition of processes.

You can see some of my past personal projects on the [projects page](/projects) and my 
public code repos on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gememma/) (including mirrord!).

I am also an artist and collector of many crafting hobbies from tailoring to bookbinding to
knitting. I own a total of eight gaming consoles and two sewing machines. I also know almost
every world flag by heart.
